# Shapes 2 Speed Solver

Uses very similar code to https://github.com/Vystel/shapez2-solver, but instead focuses on heuristics, and skipping states that are unlikely to find a solution.

Note that due to this, sometimes it is unable to find a solution where https://github.com/Vystel/shapez2-solver is able to, however in return for this, this solution can be found up to 10x faster.
